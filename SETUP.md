# Safari Track Flow - Production Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
3. **npm or yarn**: Package manager

## Database Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully initialized
3. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key

### 2. Run Database Schema

1. Copy the database schema from the conversation above
2. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Paste and run the complete schema SQL
5. Navigate to Authentication > Policies
6. Paste and run the complete RLS policies SQL

### 3. Create Initial Super Admin

1. Go to Authentication > Users in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Add user" and create a super admin user
3. Note: You'll need to manually insert the user record into the `users` table with role 'super_admin'

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Create .env file

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Replace with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Make sure to set the environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit your .env file** - It contains sensitive keys
2. **Use HTTPS in production** - Supabase requires HTTPS for production
3. **Regular security updates** - Keep dependencies updated
4. **Monitor user activity** - Use Supabase dashboard to monitor usage
5. **Backup your database** - Regular backups are essential

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication not working**: Check your Supabase URL and anon key
2. **RLS policies blocking access**: Verify policies are correctly applied
3. **User creation failing**: Ensure user exists in both auth and users table
4. **Permission denied errors**: Check user role and permissions

### Support

1. Browser console for errors
2. Supabase dashboard logs
3. Network tab for failed requests

## Next Steps

1. Create your first super admin user
2. Set up additional users through the staff management interface
3. Configure your safari packages and pricing
4. Customize the system for your specific needs
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
